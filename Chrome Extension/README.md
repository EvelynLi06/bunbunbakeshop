# Overview
This chrome extension that I built features a todo list, weather lookup, and time-look up function. The extension overrides
new tab page, users can access the todo, weather, and time list on the new tab page. In addition, the extension also has a
popout window when user clicks on the extension at the top of the chrome browser.

## Todo list
The todo list has features such as adding a new task, checkmark a task, delete a task, checking links associated to tasks,
etc. Through the extension popout window, users can check current todo list without opening a new tab, and more
importantly, users can save the current active tab link under a task in the list for future easy access through the new tab
page.
## Weather
Users can input a city name to add a city of interest into the weather list tool on the new tab page for future easy access to
check the current weather in the cities of interest.
## Times
Users can input a timezone name to add it into the times list tool on the new tab page for future easy access to check the
current time in the timezone of interest.
